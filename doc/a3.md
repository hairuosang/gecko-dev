# Diagnosis

Right now the documentation for topic http-on-examine-merged-response does not explicitly say when the topic is broadcasted

# Solution

To fix this, we change the comment for http-on-examine-merged-response to specify when the topic is broadcasted

# Testing

Since its a comment change we don't really need to do much testing.

Ran ```mach build``` and ```mach test browser/components/extensions``` it compiles and that the tests pass.
